### Pinterest Clone

Just like regular Pinterest, only with more cats!

## Getting Started

Fork or clone the repo and run `npm install` in its directory.

Run `npm install` to start it up. 

## Features

Log in with your Github account. Now you can star and unstar images. When you first log in, or when you click your name in the nav bar, you'll see all the images you have starred. Search for another user's name to see all of their images.
